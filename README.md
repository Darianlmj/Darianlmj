### Hi there üëã

#### I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science student at UNSW Sydney. In addition to that, I'm also a Casual Academic and the UI/UX director for [CSESoc](https://csesoc.unsw.edu.au) where I am helping to unify the design of the society's flagship projects.

### Projects that I've worked on

- üö® [Recallify](https://recallify.cse.lol/). A progressive web application which scans and analyses grocery receipts. It informs the user of any recalls on the products they have purchased. Made as part of the UniHack 2023 hackathon.
