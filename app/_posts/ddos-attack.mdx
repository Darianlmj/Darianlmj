      In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyberattack in which the
      perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its
      intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a
      host connected to a network.

### What is it?

A DDos (Distruibuted Denial of Service), is an attack which aims to bring down a target web application by means of flooding it's server with so much traffic that it inevitably shuts down.
If you were confused by that initial explanation, allow me to clarify your understanding with the use of an example.

### The Scenario

Imagine you are the owner of an E-commerce store. One day, you arrived at the office and tried to access your website but you weren't able to, because for some reason, your website seems to take a really long time to load. Assuming that your engineers have done their jobs properly when setting up the various servers and whatnot, you might be experiencing a DDos attack.
To properly understand the basis of a DDos attack, I need to walk you through what happens when a user tries to access your website.
When you type in a URL, a request is sent through the internet to the server where the website is hosted on. This is represented as internet traffic This server will then return a copy of the website that you requested and that is what you would see on your screen.

When a DDos attack happens, a hacker will utilise a botnet to send tons of request to that website which will essentially overload the server with tons of traffic. A botnet is a network of computers (with different IP addresses) that is infected with malware which allows a hacker to control remotely.
Because there is a ton of traffic that the server has to process, this creates a congestion in the flow of traffic and slows down or prevent's a regular user's request from being process. This effectively renders your website useless.

### How To Identify a DDos?

The most common symptom of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. But you do need to investigate further just in case there is an influx of legitimate traffic.

However, here are some of the other symptoms of a DDos attack.

- Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
- A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
- An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
- Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)

### How to Prevent a DDos?

Here's a few ways to try and prevent (or at least mitigate a DDos):

1. Blackhole Routing
   In essence, an admin creates a null route (a blackhole) and reroutes all traffic there which will get dropped by the network.

2. Rate Limiting
   Limiting the number of requests that a server will accept over a certain time frame. This method will mitigate brute forcing but will not be enough to stop a DDos completely.
